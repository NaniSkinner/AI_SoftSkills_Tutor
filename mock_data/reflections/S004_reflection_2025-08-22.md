## Mia's Response

Yesterday in student council, I presented our Water for South Sudan fundraiser idea. I was really excited because I thought everyone would love it and want to help. I spent hours putting together the presentation with statistics and a timeline.

But then the council president said they're already planning a fall fundraiser for the local food bank and they don't want to "compete for donations." She said maybe we could do our fundraiser in the spring instead.

I felt really frustrated and kind of hurt. I tried to explain that both causes are important and we could coordinate them so they don't overlap, but she said the decision was already made.

I didn't really know what to do in the moment. I said "okay" because I didn't want to argue in front of everyone, but inside I was upset. After the meeting, I talked to Mr. Thompson and he helped me understand that sometimes good ideas have to wait for the right timing.

I'm still disappointed though. I feel like when adults say "maybe later" it usually means "no." But I'm trying to not give up on the idea completely.

## Teacher Comment (Mr. Thompson)

Mia, thank you for sharing this honest reflection. I can hear how disappointed you felt, and that makes complete sense. You worked hard on that presentation and you care deeply about the cause.

I want to acknowledge something important: you handled that meeting with a lot of maturity. You didn't argue or shut down—you advocated for your idea respectfully, and when the decision went a different way, you stayed composed. That shows strong self-management.

The part where you wrote "I tried to explain... but she said the decision was already made" tells me you experienced something frustrating: having your input dismissed. That's hard for anyone, but especially hard for someone who's used to being heard and respected. This is actually a valuable (though uncomfortable) learning experience.

Here's what I noticed: you had a plan (present the idea, get approval, start the fundraiser immediately). When the plan hit an obstacle (fall fundraiser conflict), you tried to adapt (coordinate both events), but when that didn't work, you felt stuck.

This is where cognitive flexibility comes in—the ability to completely change course, not just adjust the existing plan. "Spring instead of fall" isn't a rejection of your idea; it's a different path to the same goal. Can you reframe this as "delayed" instead of "denied"?

Also, your instinct to talk to me after the meeting was excellent. Seeking support when you're upset is a great strategy.

Keep pushing for the things you believe in, Mia. Just remember that flexibility and timing are part of leadership too.

**Skills Observed:**
- Self-Awareness: Proficient (recognizes and articulates complex emotions)
- Self-Management: Proficient (stayed composed under disappointment, sought support afterward)
- Responsible Decision-Making: Proficient (advocated respectfully, considered multiple stakeholders)
- Cognitive Flexibility: Developing (struggled to see alternative timing as valid option)
- Communication: Proficient (expressed ideas clearly and respectfully)
