## Eva's Response

I'm really proud that I got better at staying organized. At the beginning of the year I was always losing stuff and forgetting assignments. Now I use my planner every day and I actually check it.

I think I also got better at listening to people when they're talking instead of just waiting for my turn. Marcus told me I don't interrupt as much anymore which made me feel good.

I like that I can speak in front of the class now without getting super nervous. The presentation on "The Hate U Give" went really well and I felt confident.

I still need to work on remembering small details but I'm getting better. Ms. Rodriguez doesn't have to remind me as much about citing sources now.
