## Pat's Response

In the discussion about water stuff I actually talked a lot and people listened to me. Usually I don't say much because I feel like my ideas are dumb but this time I had things to say.

I've been watching more documentaries at home about climate change and water problems. It makes me mad that we're messing up the planet and not doing enough to fix it.

Mr Thompson said I made good connections. That felt nice. Keisha told me after class that she agreed with my points about it not being fair to poor families.

I'm still bad at homework and getting organized but maybe I'm getting better at thinking about things and speaking up.

## Teacher Comment

Pat - I'm really proud of this growth! You found a topic you care about and that lit a fire under you. Your voice matters in discussions.

Now let's work on channeling that same energy into staying organized with assignments. You can do both.

**Skills:** Way more confident. Actually participating. Finding motivation through topics connected to justice.
