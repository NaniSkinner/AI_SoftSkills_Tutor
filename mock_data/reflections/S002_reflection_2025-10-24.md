## Lucas's Response

In math class Kenji was having trouble organizing his notes for the test. I showed him how I use tabs and color coding to separate different topics. He said it helped him study better.

It felt good to help someone. Usually I just do my own work and don't pay attention to what other people are doing. But when I saw Kenji looking stressed I remembered how Ms. Rodriguez said I could share my strategies with others.

Kenji got a B on the test and told me my system helped. That made me feel proud.

I'm trying to be better at noticing when people need help instead of just focusing on my own stuff.
