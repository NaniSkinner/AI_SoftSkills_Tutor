## Eva's Response

This week in PE, we were playing volleyball and my team was losing really bad. I started feeling really frustrated because I kept missing the ball and people on my team were getting annoyed. I think I was feeling frustrated and also kind of embarrassed?

When I feel like that I usually try to take deep breaths like we learned in health class last year. I did that a couple times and it helped a little. I also just tried to remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and it's just a game. By the end of class I felt better.

I think what made me the most frustrated was that I really wanted to do well and I felt like I was letting everyone down. It's hard when you try your best but it still doesn't work out.

## Teacher Comment (Ms. Rodriguez)

Eva, I appreciate your honesty in this reflection. You did a nice job naming your emotions—frustration and embarrassment. It takes awareness to recognize when you're feeling multiple things at once.

I'm glad you remembered the deep breathing strategy from health class. That shows you're building a toolkit of coping strategies. Next time, you might also try talking to a teammate or your teacher in the moment. Sometimes just naming what you're feeling out loud can help, too.

Your comment about "trying your best but it still doesn't work out" shows real insight. That's a tough feeling, and it's something everyone experiences. Keep practicing recognizing and managing these emotions—you're on the right track!

**Skills Observed:**
- Self-Awareness: Developing (can name emotions with some complexity)
- Self-Management: Developing (uses coping strategies when prompted by past learning)
