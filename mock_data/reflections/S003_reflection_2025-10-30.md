## Pat's Response

I can actually start my homework now without staring at it for an hour. Mr Thompson helped me make a system where I write down one small step I can do first. Like instead of "do math worksheet" I write "do problems 1-3." Then it doesn't feel impossible.

I also got better at speaking up in class. At the start of the year I never raised my hand but now I do especially when we talk about stuff like climate change or fairness.

I'm still not perfect with organization but I'm using a folder now and I don't lose as many papers.

The water awareness campaign we're doing is cool. I never thought I could actually make something happen at school but we got permission and everything.

## Teacher Comment

Pat - You should be incredibly proud of this growth. You went from feeling helpless to taking action. That's huge.

The step-by-step approach is working because you're using it. Keep it up.

**Skills:** Self-awareness good - sees own progress. Task initiation way improved with systems. Self-management better. Finding voice through advocacy.
