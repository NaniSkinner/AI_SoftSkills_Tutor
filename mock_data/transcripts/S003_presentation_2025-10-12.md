## Brief Transcript

Pat presented research on global water inequality. Came in early to set up slides and test the projector - first time I've seen Pat do that kind of prep.

Presentation had clear structure: problem, causes, solutions. Pat spoke with real passion about how unfair it is that location determines access to clean water.

Used specific statistics and cited sources properly. Slides were simple but effective.

Q&A: When asked "what can middle schoolers do about this," Pat had actual ideas - fundraisers, awareness campaigns, writing to local government about protecting water resources. Not just vague "we should care more" stuff.

Pat stayed after class to ask if the presentation could be turned into a proposal for student council. Wants to actually do something about the issue.

## Teacher Note

Pat has completely turned around this semester. The passion for justice/fairness topics unlocked something. Still needs organizational systems but when Pat cares about the content, everything else follows.

This is the kid I knew was in there. Breakthrough moment.

**Skills:** Communication strong when topic matters. Critical thinking excellent. Task initiation way better - actually prepared ahead of time. Responsible decision-making showing through advocacy.
