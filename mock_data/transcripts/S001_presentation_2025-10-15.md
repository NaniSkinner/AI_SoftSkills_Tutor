## Brief Transcript

Eva presented her book analysis to the class. She spoke clearly without reading directly from notes. Made good eye contact. Used specific quotes from the book to support her points about activism and finding your voice.

When classmate asked a question she didn't expect ("Do you think the author's message applies to our school?"), Eva took a moment to think then gave a thoughtful answer connecting the book's themes to recent discussions about student voice in school policies.

Presentation was well-organized - had clear intro, three main points, conclusion. Stayed within time limit.
