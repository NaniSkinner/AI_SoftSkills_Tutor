# Teacher Observation Note

**Date:** August 22, 2025
**Student:** Eva (S001)
**Teacher:** Ms. Rodriguez
**Context:** Science class - Lab work on simple machines (pulleys and levers)
**Duration:** 50-minute class period

## Observation

Today's lab required students to work in pairs to test different pulley systems and record their observations. Eva was paired with Kenji.

**Positive Observations:**

Eva demonstrated strong relationship skills during the lab. When Kenji initially struggled to understand the setup instructions, Eva patiently explained the steps without taking over the task. She said, "Okay, so the diagram shows we need to loop the rope through the fixed pulley first, then through the moveable one. Want to try it while I hold this in place?" This showed both clear communication and respect for her partner's learning process.

When their first attempt at creating a mechanical advantage system didn't work as expected, Eva remained encouraging. She told Kenji, "It's okay, the instructions are kind of confusing. Let's look at what the other groups are doing." Rather than getting frustrated, she was resourceful and collaborative.

**Areas for Growth:**

I noticed Eva had some difficulty with the planning and organization aspects of the lab. When I distributed the worksheets at the beginning of class, she spent the first 5 minutes looking for a pencil in her backpack and couldn't find her science folder. She eventually borrowed supplies from Kenji.

Additionally, when it came time to record data in an organized table, Eva's initial attempt was somewhat scattered. She wrote observations in the margins rather than in the designated columns. After I provided a gentle reminder about using the data table, she corrected course, but it required that external prompt.

Her written observations were thoughtful once she got organized: "The fixed pulley changed the direction of force but didn't reduce the effort needed. The moveable pulley reduced effort by about half." This shows good critical thinking and attention to the experiment's purpose.

**Follow-up:**

I plan to check in with Eva about her organizational systems. She might benefit from a weekly backpack/binder cleanout routine and some explicit instruction on how to use data tables and graphic organizers effectively. Her intellectual capabilities are strong—she just needs support in managing materials and structuring her work.

**Skills Observed:**
- Relationship Skills: Proficient (patient, collaborative, respectful partner)
- Communication: Proficient (clear explanations, encouraging tone)
- Critical Thinking: Proficient (thoughtful analysis of results)
- Organization: Developing (difficulty locating materials, initial scattered data recording)
- Planning & Prioritization: Developing (needed prompting to use structured data table)
- Self-Management: Developing (recovered from setback but needed external support)
