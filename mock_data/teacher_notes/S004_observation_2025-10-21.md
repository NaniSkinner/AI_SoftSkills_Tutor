# Teacher Observation Note

**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Student:** Mia (S004)
**Teacher:** Mr. Thompson
**Context:** Water awareness booth at fall fundraiser

---

Mia organized the info booth at the haunted house fundraiser. Had pamphlets, posters, sign-up sheet for spring fundraiser.

What impressed me: another student group set up their booth right next to hers and it was way flashier with music and decorations. Saw Mia's face fall for a second.

But then she adjusted. Went over and suggested they coordinate - she'd send people to their booth after they signed up at hers. Turned potential competition into collaboration.

By end of night they'd collected 47 emails for the spring fundraiser and raised awareness with probably 100+ students.

Mia told me afterward "I had to let go of my vision of how it would look and just focus on the goal." That's real growth.

**Skills:** Leadership excellent - adapts to situations. Cognitive flexibility now a strength. Collaboration advanced - builds partnerships instead of competing. Social awareness strong.
