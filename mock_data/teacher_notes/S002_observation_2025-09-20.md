# Teacher Observation Note

**Date:** September 20, 2025
**Student:** Lucas (S002)
**Teacher:** Ms. Rodriguez
**Context:** Class debate on school uniform policy

---

Lucas volunteered to be on the "pro-uniform" team. Unusual for him to speak up in that kind of activity.

During prep time he had note cards organized by argument type (safety, cost, equality). Very systematic. But when his teammate Sarah wanted to add an argument about peer pressure, Lucas looked uncomfortable and said "that's not in my research."

During the actual debate Lucas did well presenting his prepared points. Clear speaker, good eye contact. When the other team brought up a counterargument he hadn't prepared for, he got quiet for a minute but then responded okay.

After debate he told Sarah "your peer pressure idea was actually good, I should've listened earlier." Nice to see him recognize that.

**Skills:** Still super organized. Getting better at going with the flow when things don't go exactly as planned. Communication improving - spoke confidently in front of class.
