# Teacher Observation Note

**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Student:** Lucas (S002)
**Teacher:** Ms. Rodriguez
**Context:** Collaborative writing activity - peer editing

---

Lucas paired with Kenji for peer editing. Saw Lucas explain his organizational system to Kenji - color-coded editing marks for different types of errors. Kenji seemed genuinely interested.

Lucas gave Kenji specific, helpful feedback on his essay. Pointed out three places where evidence could be stronger and suggested where to add transitions. All constructive, not mean.

When Kenji suggested Lucas's intro paragraph was confusing, Lucas actually listened instead of defending it. Said "okay let me try rewriting it" and asked Kenji what specifically was unclear.

Still has everything organized perfectly. But now he's using those skills to help other people instead of just working alone.

**Skills:** Organization advanced - now teaching it to others. Way better at taking feedback. Collaboration much improved.
