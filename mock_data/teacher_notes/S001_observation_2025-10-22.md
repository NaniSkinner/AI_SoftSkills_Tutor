# Teacher Observation Note

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Student:** Eva (S001)
**Teacher:** Ms. Rodriguez
**Context:** Group project final presentations

---

Eva's group presented their environmental action plan. She coordinated the whole thing - everyone knew their part, transitions were smooth.

Best part: when tech didn't work (projector died mid-presentation), Eva just kept going. Said "we'll show you these stats on the handout" and adapted without getting flustered.

She's also getting better at not interrupting. Noticed her stop herself twice when she got excited - waited for teammate to finish before adding her thought.

Planner is working great for her. Had all materials ready, knew exactly where everything was.

**Skills:** Becoming a strong leader. Organization is now a strength. Communication excellent - both speaking and listening better.
