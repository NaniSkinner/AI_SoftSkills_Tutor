# Teacher Observation Note

**Date:** September 12, 2025
**Student:** Eva (S001)
**Teacher:** Ms. Rodriguez
**Context:** Group project work - Environmental science poster

---

Eva worked with Marcus and Lily on the climate change poster. She took charge of organizing who does what - made a quick list and assigned tasks without being bossy about it. Marcus seemed glad someone was organizing things.

Good moment: When Lily's sketch of the carbon cycle didn't match what the book showed, Eva said "that's creative but maybe we should stick closer to the diagram so people understand it." Didn't make Lily feel bad but kept the group on track.

Saw Eva using her planner to write down the project timeline. She had everything color coded by due date. Much better than last month when she was digging through her backpack for stuff.

Still needs reminders to include sources on her slides - caught that before she printed. But she fixed it right away.

**Skills:** Communication getting stronger. Organization much improved with the planner system. Still working on remembering all the details without prompts.
