# Teacher Observation Note

**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Student:** Pat (S003)
**Teacher:** Mr. Thompson
**Context:** Group work - planning awareness campaign

---

Pat working with Riley and Keisha on water awareness campaign for school. Pat brought materials organized in a folder - huge improvement.

Pat took initiative assigning tasks to group members. Suggested they make posters for hallways, do morning announcements, and set up info table at lunch. Riley and Keisha both nodded along - they trust Pat's ideas now.

Pat still needs reminders about deadlines but actually writing them down now instead of just saying "okay."

When Keisha disagreed about poster design, Pat listened and they compromised. Would've shut down in August but now engaging with feedback.

**Skills:** Organization improving - using folder system. Task initiation way better. Collaboration much stronger. Found motivation through topics that matter to them.
