## What did your partner do well?

Lucas helped me a lot with organizing my notes. He showed me his color coding system and it made studying easier. He was patient when I didn't understand something.

Lucas also came up with good study questions for our test prep. He shared his notes with the whole group.

## What could they improve?

Nothing really. Lucas was a good study partner this time.

**5/5**

## Teacher Note

Big change from the peer feedback Lucas got in August. Kenji rated him 5/5 with no criticisms. Lucas has really grown in his ability to work with others.
