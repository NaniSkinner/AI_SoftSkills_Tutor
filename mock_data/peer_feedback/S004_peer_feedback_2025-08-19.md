## Feedback Questions

### 1. What did your partner do well during this project/activity?

Mia was an amazing leader for our group. She organized all our meetings, made sure we stayed on track, and helped everyone feel included. When Jayden was nervous about presenting, Mia practiced with him after school and gave him really helpful tips about how to use note cards.

She also came up with the idea for the fundraiser and did all the research about how much a well costs. She's really good at finding information and making it easy to understand.

The best part was that Mia always asked for our opinions. She didn't just tell us what to do—she asked "What do you guys think?" and actually listened to our answers.

### 2. What is one thing your partner could work on to be an even better collaborator?

This is hard to say because Mia was such a good group member. But if I had to pick something... sometimes I felt like Mia had already decided what we were going to do before asking for our input. Like, she would say "What do you think?" but she'd already made a whole plan.

Also, when we were trying to decide between doing a bake sale or a car wash for the fundraiser, I suggested we could do both and spread them out over two weeks. Mia said that was a good idea, but then she kept talking about the bake sale like that was the only option. It seemed like she had a hard time changing her plan once she'd decided on it.

I don't think Mia meant to ignore my idea. I think she just really likes having a clear plan and sticking to it.

### 3. On a scale of 1-5, how well did your partner contribute to the team? (5 = excellent)

**Rating: 5/5**

Mia contributed more than anyone else and made our whole project better. I learned a lot from working with her.

## Teacher Note (Mr. Thompson)

Sofia provided thoughtful feedback that highlights both Mia's exceptional strengths and a subtle growth area.

The feedback about Mia having a plan before asking for input is insightful. This is a common challenge for strong leaders—they're often so good at planning that they struggle to genuinely incorporate ideas that deviate from their vision. Mia's cognitive flexibility may be her primary area for growth.

I'm noting Sofia's comment about the bake sale vs. car wash decision. This suggests Mia might benefit from explicit instruction on holding plans more loosely and being more open to alternative approaches.

That said, Sofia's overall rating of 5/5 and her comment about learning from Mia show that these issues are minor compared to Mia's considerable strengths.
