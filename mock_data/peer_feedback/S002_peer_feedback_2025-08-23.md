## Feedback Questions

### 1. What did your partner do well during this project/activity?

Lucas was really organized! He brought all the materials we needed and had them labeled in separate bags. He also made a checklist of all the steps we needed to do for each experiment, which helped us not forget anything. When I wasn't sure what to do next, he always knew because he had read the instructions really carefully.

He was also really good at measuring things exactly. Like, when we had to measure the force with the spring scale, he made sure it was precise to the decimal point.

### 2. What is one thing your partner could work on to be an even better collaborator?

Sometimes Lucas wanted to do things a certain way and didn't really want to hear other ideas. Like, I suggested we could try testing the pulley system with different weights to see if there was a pattern, but he said that wasn't in the instructions so we shouldn't do it. I think it would have been interesting to explore more.

Also, when I made a mistake measuring something, Lucas seemed kind of frustrated. He didn't say anything mean, but I could tell he was annoyed. It would help if he could be more patient when people make mistakes.

### 3. On a scale of 1-5, how well did your partner contribute to the team? (5 = excellent)

**Rating: 4/5**

He definitely contributed a lot and we got everything done. I just think we could have communicated a little better.

## Teacher Note (Ms. Rodriguez)

Eva provided thoughtful and balanced feedback. She acknowledged Lucas's clear strengths (organization, precision, preparation) while also offering constructive observations about his collaborative style. This is exactly the kind of feedback that helps students grow.

Lucas should read this carefully. Eva's suggestion about being open to ideas that go beyond the instructions is valuable—creativity and exploration are important parts of science. Her comment about patience when others make mistakes is also important for building stronger relationships with teammates.

**Skills Observed (Lucas, via Eva's feedback):**
- Organization: Advanced (exceeded expectations, systematic material preparation)
- Task Initiation: Proficient (thoroughly prepared before lab)
- Collaboration: Developing (contributed strongly but struggled with flexibility and patience)
- Cognitive Flexibility: Developing (resistant to ideas outside the plan)
- Relationship Skills: Developing (frustration visible, needs work on emotional regulation with partners)
