## Pat's Response

I felt really bad in math class when Mr Thompson asked about my homework. I forgot to do it again and I felt embarrassed because everyone else had theirs. I didn't really know what to say so I just said I forgot.

I don't know why I can't remember to do my homework. I always tell myself I'm going to do it but then I get home and I forget or I can't find the worksheet or I don't understand it and I give up.

When I feel bad like that I usually just try to not think about it. Sometimes I go on my phone or watch videos to feel better.

## Teacher Comment (Mr. Thompson)

Pat, I appreciate you being honest about how you felt. Embarrassment is a really uncomfortable feeling, and it's brave of you to name it here.

I want you to know that I don't ask about homework to make anyone feel bad—I ask because I want to help you succeed. When you forget assignments, it tells me we need to build some systems to help you remember and organize your work.

You wrote, "I don't know why I can't remember to do my homework." Let's work on this together. Here are some things we can try:
- A homework checklist you fill out at the end of each class
- A specific spot in your backpack (maybe a folder?) just for homework
- Breaking assignments into smaller steps so they feel less overwhelming

You also mentioned that when you feel bad, you try to distract yourself with your phone or videos. That's a normal response, but it doesn't actually solve the problem—it just delays it. This week, let's practice one new strategy: when you feel overwhelmed, try writing down ONE small thing you can do right now. Just one. Not the whole assignment. Just one small step.

You're capable of doing this work, Pat. We just need to build the right systems to help you.

**Skills Observed:**
- Self-Awareness: Emerging (can name emotions but doesn't understand patterns or triggers)
- Self-Management: Emerging (uses avoidance rather than coping strategies)
- Task Initiation: Emerging (acknowledges pattern of procrastination, feels helpless to change it)
