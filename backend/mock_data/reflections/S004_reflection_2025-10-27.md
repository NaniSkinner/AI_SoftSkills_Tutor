## Mia's Response

I learned that things don't have to go exactly according to plan to still be successful.

At the beginning of the year I had this whole perfect plan for the Water for South Sudan fundraiser and when it got postponed I was really upset. But then we did the awareness booth at the fall event and it actually worked out better because we had more time to prepare for spring.

I also learned that other people have good ideas too and I don't always have to be the one with the plan. In discussions I've been trying to listen more and let other people lead instead of always jumping in with my ideas.

Mr Thompson told me I'm getting better at being flexible and he's right. It's still hard when things change but I'm learning to adapt.

I'm proud that we're actually going to do the spring fundraiser and it's going to be better because we took time to plan it right.

## Teacher Comment

Mia - This reflection shows real maturity. Learning to be flexible while maintaining your vision is advanced leadership. Very proud.

**Skills:** Self-awareness excellent. Cognitive flexibility now a strength. Responsible decision-making strong - thinks long-term. Still a natural leader but more collaborative now.
