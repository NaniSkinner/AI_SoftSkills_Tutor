## Lucas's Response

Yesterday in group discussion I felt annoyed when people wanted to change my discussion plan. I spent a long time making the questions and organizing them by theme and then everyone wanted to just talk about random stuff.

I don't really know why it bothered me so much. I guess I felt like my work didn't matter. But also I know that discussions are supposed to be flexible. Ms. Rodriguez reminded me of that.

I tried to go with it even though it felt uncomfortable. I listened to Jordan's idea about the release ceremony and it was actually pretty good. I wrote it down in my notes.

I'm not really good at talking about feelings. I usually just try to focus on the task and ignore how I feel. That usually works.

## Teacher Comment (Ms. Rodriguez)

Lucas, thank you for being honest. It takes courage to name when something bothers you, even in writing.

I want to affirm something important: your work DID matter. Your organized questions gave the group a strong foundation, and everyone appreciated how prepared you were. The fact that the conversation took a different direction doesn't mean your preparation was wasted—it actually gave everyone confidence to add their own ideas.

I'm noticing that you wrote, "I'm not really good at talking about feelings. I usually just try to focus on the task and ignore how I feel." This is really insightful self-awareness. Many people cope this way, and it can be helpful. But I also want to encourage you to practice naming your emotions, like you did here. You said you felt "annoyed" and that you felt like your work "didn't matter." Those are real, valid emotions, and being able to identify them is a strength, not a weakness.

Here's something to think about: When you understand your own emotions, it helps you understand other people's emotions too. This can make you an even better discussion leader and collaborator.

Keep practicing this reflective work, Lucas. You're building an important skill.

**Skills Observed:**
- Self-Awareness: Developing (can name emotions but struggles to elaborate on them)
- Self-Management: Developing (focuses on tasks to avoid emotional discomfort)
- Cognitive Flexibility: Developing (recognized need to adapt but found it uncomfortable)
