## Lucas's Response

In science lab we had to work in groups of 3. I was with Amir and Jordan. It was okay but kind of frustrating.

Amir kept making jokes when we were supposed to be working and Jordan forgot to bring the worksheet so we had to share mine. I had organized all my materials and color coded my notes but they didn't really care about that.

The good part was we finished the lab on time and got all our data recorded. I showed them my system for organizing the data table and Amir said it made sense.

The hard part was when Jordan wanted to try the experiment a different way than the instructions said. I thought we should just follow the steps but Mr. Harris said it was okay to experiment. It worked out fine but I was worried we'd mess it up.

## Teacher Comment

Lucas - I see you're trying to be more flexible when working with others. That's growth! Jordan's idea to modify the experiment showed good scientific thinking, and I'm glad you went with it even though it felt uncomfortable.

Your organizational skills helped the group succeed. Keep sharing those strategies with classmates.

**Skills:** Organization still excellent. Working on being flexible with teammates.
