# Teacher Observation Note

**Date:** September 14, 2025
**Student:** Mia (S004)
**Teacher:** Mr. Thompson
**Context:** Student council meeting - planning fall fundraiser

---

Observed Mia presenting at student council meeting. She came prepared with a revised plan for the Water for South Sudan fundraiser moved to spring.

Interesting moment: Council president announced they're doing a haunted house fundraiser for fall instead of the food bank one. Mia's face showed she was caught off guard. Could see her processing - this was different info than she'd been told.

Instead of arguing, Mia took a breath and asked questions: "When was this decided? Who's organizing it? Can we coordinate with it?" Much more flexible than I expected based on last month.

She suggested her group could run a water bottle booth at the haunted house to raise awareness even if they're not ready for the full fundraiser yet. President agreed. Mia adapted her plan on the spot.

After the meeting Mia told me she was disappointed but "at least we're doing something." Learning to work with what's possible instead of what's perfect.

**Skills:** Still a natural leader. Getting better at rolling with changes. Problem-solving in the moment instead of shutting down.
