# Teacher Observation Note

**Date:** August 14, 2025
**Student:** Pat (S003)
**Teacher:** Mr. Thompson
**Context:** First week of school - Math class, homework collection and warm-up problem
**Duration:** First 15 minutes of class

## Observation

This is my third day observing Pat, and I'm noticing some concerning patterns that I want to document early so we can provide appropriate support.

**Task Initiation & Organization:**

When I asked students to take out their homework at the beginning of class, Pat spent nearly 5 minutes digging through their backpack. The backpack appeared to be stuffed with loose papers, crumpled worksheets, and what looked like several days' worth of lunch napkins. Pat eventually found a paper that might have been the homework, but it was so crumpled that I couldn't tell if it was complete.

When I moved on to the warm-up problem on the board (a simple two-step equation), Pat didn't start working for several minutes. Other students had already begun, but Pat was still looking for a pencil. When I asked if Pat needed supplies, the response was, "I think I have one somewhere," followed by more rummaging.

After I provided a pencil from my desk supply, Pat stared at the problem for another 2-3 minutes without writing anything. When I circulated and asked, "What's your first step?" Pat said, "I don't know where to start." I prompted: "What operation do you see first?" and Pat was able to identify addition, but then seemed stuck again.

**Emotional Regulation:**

When I gave a gentle reminder about completing homework on time (the assignment was 3 days late), Pat became visibly upset—shoulders hunched, avoided eye contact, and mumbled, "I forgot." When I asked, "How can we help you remember next time?" Pat shrugged and said, "I don't know. I'm just not good at this stuff."

This kind of defeatist self-talk is concerning. Pat seems to interpret normal expectations as criticism and shuts down rather than problem-solving.

**Positive Note:**

During our class discussion about word problems, Pat made an interesting comment about fairness in a scenario involving sharing pizza. Pat said, "But what if one person is allergic to cheese? Then equal slices isn't actually fair." This showed creative thinking and attention to real-world complexity. It wasn't directly related to the math, but it showed Pat can think critically about ethical dimensions of problems.

**Next Steps:**

I'm going to:
1. Set up a daily check-in system where Pat shows me their organized materials
2. Provide explicit, step-by-step written instructions for starting tasks
3. Connect with Pat's other teachers to see if this pattern is consistent
4. Consider a referral to our learning specialist for executive functioning support

Pat has potential, but without significant scaffolding and support systems, I'm worried about this student falling further behind.

**Skills Observed:**
- Task Initiation: Emerging (significant procrastination, cannot generate first steps independently)
- Organization: Emerging (chaotic materials, cannot locate necessary items)
- Self-Management: Emerging (shuts down when faced with difficulty, defeatist self-talk)
- Communication: Developing (can express ideas but shuts down under stress)
- Creativity & Innovation: Developing (made insightful connection about fairness)
- Critical Thinking: Developing (noticed complexity in word problem scenario)
