## Presentation Transcript

**Mia:** *Steps to front of room confidently, makes eye contact with class* Good morning, everyone. Our group read "Long Walk to Water" by Linda Sue Park, and we're going to share what we learned about the global water crisis and how one person can make a difference. Jayden is going to start with the summary, then Sofia will explain the historical context, and I'll finish with our call to action. *Gestures to Jayden* Go ahead!

**Jayden:** *Looks at notes nervously* Um, so the book is about... uh... *loses place in notes*

**Mia:** *Quietly, encouraging* It's about Salva and Nya, right?

**Jayden:** Oh yeah. So it's about Salva, who's a refugee from Sudan, and Nya, who walks hours every day to get water. Their stories are happening in different time periods but they're connected.

**Sofia:** *Takes over* The book is based on true events from the Second Sudanese Civil War, which lasted from 1983 to 2005. Over 2 million people died and 4 million were displaced. Salva's story shows how children were separated from their families and had to walk hundreds of miles to refugee camps.

**Mia:** *Nods approvingly, then addresses class* So here's the part that really affected our group. The real Salva Dut went on to found a nonprofit called Water for South Sudan. Since 2003, they've drilled over 500 wells, providing clean water to more than 400,000 people. *Displays poster board with statistics*

One person—one kid who survived something terrible—decided to go back and help. And that's what inspired our call to action.

**Audience Member:** *Raises hand* How do you know that's real?

**Mia:** Great question. We researched it. *Pulls up iPad* Here's the organization's website, waterfor southsudan.org, and here's an interview with the real Salva Dut from NPR. We wanted to make sure everything we're telling you is accurate.

**Mr. Thompson:** I appreciate that you verified your sources, Mia.

**Mia:** Thanks. So, our call to action. We want our class to do something real. *Looks at group members* We've been talking, and we think we should organize a fundraiser for Water for South Sudan. Even a small well costs about $15,000, but every dollar helps. We could do a bake sale, a car wash, or maybe partner with the student council.

**Sofia:** Mia made a presentation for student council next week.

**Mia:** *Smiles* I figured we should have a plan before asking people to support it. I calculated that if every student in our grade donated just $5, we'd raise $300. That's not enough for a well, but it could support maintenance on an existing one.

**Audience Member:** What if people don't want to donate?

**Mia:** *Pauses, thinks* That's fair. Not everyone can afford to donate. So we're also thinking about awareness. Even if we just get people to learn about the water crisis, that's valuable. We could make posters for the hallway, or do a presentation at an assembly.

**Jayden:** *Quietly* Mia came up with most of this.

**Mia:** *Quickly* No, we all worked on it. Jayden researched the civil war, Sofia found the NPR interview, and I just... put it together. It was a team effort.

**Mr. Thompson:** Questions for the group?

**Audience Member:** How long did Nya have to walk every day?

**Sofia:** Eight hours roundtrip. Twice a day during the dry season.

**Audience Member:** That's insane.

**Mia:** Right? That's why this matters. Kids our age in South Sudan spend their entire day getting water instead of going to school. We're really lucky, and I think we should use that privilege to help.

## Teacher Observation Note (Mr. Thompson)

This was one of the strongest group presentations I've seen from 7th graders. Mia was clearly the driving force behind the project, and her leadership skills are exceptional for her age.

**Strengths:**

Mia demonstrated Advanced-level collaboration and communication. She organized the presentation structure, ensured all group members had roles, and stepped in supportively when Jayden lost his place. Her encouragement ("It's about Salva and Nya, right?") was gentle and didn't embarrass him.

Her communication was sophisticated—she made eye contact with the audience, used transitions between speakers, and responded to questions thoughtfully. When challenged about the accuracy of her facts, she provided evidence immediately, showing both preparation and critical thinking.

Most impressively, Mia showed genuine social awareness. When Jayden pointed out that she'd done most of the work, she deflected credit back to the team. This wasn't false modesty—she genuinely wanted to make sure everyone felt valued. That's mature leadership.

Her proposal for the fundraiser showed Advanced planning skills. She had researched costs, calculated potential donations, and even considered barriers ("What if people don't want to donate?") with alternative solutions.

**Area for Growth:**

The one moment where I saw a crack in Mia's confidence was when the audience member asked "What if people don't want to donate?" She paused longer than usual, and I could see her mentally recalibrating. This isn't necessarily a weakness—it shows she's thinking critically—but I wonder how Mia handles situations where her well-laid plans encounter genuine resistance or failure.

I'm going to watch for cognitive flexibility challenges. Mia is so good at planning that when things don't go according to plan, she might struggle. We'll see how she handles the student council meeting next week.

**Skills Observed:**
- Collaboration: Advanced (leads effectively, ensures all voices are heard, shares credit)
- Communication: Advanced (persuasive, clear, adapts to audience, uses evidence)
- Social Awareness: Advanced (reads emotional cues, responds supportively)
- Relationship Skills: Advanced (builds trust, encourages others, empathetic)
- Planning & Prioritization: Proficient (detailed preparation, logical structure)
- Critical Thinking: Proficient (evaluates sources, anticipates questions)
- Global Awareness: Proficient (understands and cares about international issues)
- Responsible Decision-Making: Proficient (considers ethics and community impact)
