## Transcript

**Mr. Thompson:** Mia, you're facilitating today's discussion on AI and privacy.

**Mia:** Okay, so I know we all have different opinions on this. Let's start by going around - what's your biggest concern about AI?

**Carlos:** I think it's creepy that companies track everything we do online.

**Aisha:** Yeah but we agreed to it when we downloaded the apps.

**DeShawn:** Did we though? Nobody reads those terms and conditions.

**Mia:** Both good points. *Pauses* Actually, what if we flip this - instead of debating whether it's creepy, what if we discuss what regulations should exist?

**Carlos:** Like what?

**Mia:** I don't know - I'm asking you guys. That's the cool part. We can come up with ideas together.

**Aisha:** Maybe companies have to explain in simple language what data they're collecting?

**DeShawn:** And we should be able to delete our data if we want.

**Mia:** *Writing notes* Okay those are both interesting. Carlos, what do you think?

*Discussion continues with Mia guiding but not controlling*

## Teacher Note

Mia has really grown in how she leads discussions. Instead of having everything planned out, she's letting the conversation flow more naturally. Still organized but way more flexible.

When Carlos brought up a completely different angle than she expected, she rolled with it and even built on his idea.

She's learning that good leadership sometimes means not having all the answers.

**Skills:** Collaboration and communication both advanced. Cognitive flexibility way better - comfortable with ambiguity now. Critical thinking strong. Responsible decision-making showing through ethics focus.
