## Transcript

**Mr. Thompson:** Okay, your group is discussing the new water restrictions the city announced. Pat, you had some thoughts about this?

**Pat:** *Sits up straighter* Yeah, I watched that documentary you sent about water inequality. It's messed up that rich neighborhoods have pools but some places don't even have clean drinking water.

**Keisha:** True but that's not what the article is about.

**Pat:** I know but it's connected. Like, why are they telling regular people to take shorter showers when companies waste way more water?

**DeShawn:** That's actually a good point.

**Pat:** *More animated* And the article says they're charging fees if you go over the limit but people with more money can just pay it. That's not fair. Poor families will have to choose between clean clothes and paying the fee.

**Riley:** So what should they do instead?

**Pat:** *Pauses, thinking* Maybe charge companies more? Or like, make pools illegal during droughts? I don't know all the answers but the current plan isn't fair.

**Mr. Thompson:** Pat, you're making some sophisticated connections here. Anyone else want to respond to Pat's points?

## Teacher Note

Big change from last month. Pat actually started the discussion and stayed engaged the whole time. The justice/fairness angle really got Pat going - much more energy than I've seen before.

Pat's ideas weren't perfectly organized but they showed real critical thinking. Making the connection between the local water policy and broader inequality issues is exactly the kind of analysis I want to see.

Still needs work on backing up arguments with specific evidence from the text, but the passion and insight are there.

**Skills:** Critical thinking getting much stronger. Communication way better when topic connects to fairness/justice. Started participating without needing to be called on.
