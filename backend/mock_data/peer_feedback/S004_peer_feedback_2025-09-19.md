## What did your partner do well?

Mia helped me understand the instructions when I was confused. She explained it in a way that made sense without making me feel stupid. When our first experiment didn't work she stayed calm and said we should try again.

She also let me pick which part I wanted to do instead of just telling me what to do.

## What could they improve?

Mia had already done research on the experiment before we even started so she knew what was going to happen. That was good but also it felt like she already had all the answers and we were just following her plan. I wish we could have figured some of it out together.

## Rating: How well did they work with the group? (1-5)

**5/5**

She's really good to work with and helps people a lot.

## Teacher Note

Jayden's feedback shows Mia is still very prepared (maybe over-prepared?). But he rated her 5/5 so clearly her leadership style is working for the group. The prep is actually a strength even if it means less discovery for partners.
