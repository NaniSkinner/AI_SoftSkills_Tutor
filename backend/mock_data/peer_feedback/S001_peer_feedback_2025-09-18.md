## What did your partner do well?

Eva was really good at making sure we all knew what to do. She made a list and we all picked what we wanted to work on. She also helped me with my part when I didn't get how to make the graph.

## What could they improve?

Sometimes Eva talks a lot and doesn't let other people finish. Like when Lily was trying to explain her idea Eva started talking about something else before Lily was done.

## Rating: How well did they work with the group? (1-5)

**4/5**

She did a good job but could listen more.

## Teacher Note

Marcus gave honest feedback. The comment about Eva interrupting is something I've noticed too - she gets excited about ideas and jumps in. Good to see a peer noticed it as well.
