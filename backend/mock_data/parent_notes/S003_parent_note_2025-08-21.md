## Parent's Message

Hi Mr. Thompson,

Thanks for your email about Pat's missing assignments. I'm honestly not surprised. We've been struggling with homework for years now.

At home, Pat has a really hard time getting started on anything. We've tried setting timers, making schedules, offering rewards—nothing seems to stick for more than a few days. Pat will sit at the kitchen table with homework out and just... stare at it for an hour. When I ask what's wrong, Pat says "I don't know how to start" or "I don't get it."

The thing is, I know Pat is smart. When we watch documentaries together (especially about climate change or social issues), Pat asks really thoughtful questions and makes connections I wouldn't have thought of. Pat got really fired up last month about a news story on water access inequality and wanted to research it for hours. So the curiosity and intelligence are there.

I think Pat just gets overwhelmed really easily and doesn't know how to break things down into steps. And when Pat feels overwhelmed, Pat shuts down. It's been this way since elementary school, but it's gotten worse this year with the transition to middle school.

We're open to any strategies you think might help. Should we consider meeting with a counselor or learning specialist?

Thanks,
Jamie Chen

## Teacher Response

Hi Jamie,

Thank you so much for this context. It really helps me understand what Pat is experiencing.

Everything you've described—difficulty initiating tasks, getting overwhelmed by multi-step processes, shutting down under stress—points to executive functioning challenges, which are very common and very treatable with the right support systems.

I'm actually really encouraged by what you shared about Pat's engagement with documentaries and social issues. That tells me Pat has strong critical thinking skills and a natural curiosity when the topic is meaningful and presented in an accessible way. That's a huge asset we can build on.

Here's what I'd like to try:

**In Class:**
- Daily check-ins to help Pat organize materials
- Explicit, visual instructions for all assignments
- Breaking larger tasks into smaller, achievable steps
- Leveraging Pat's interest in social issues through project-based learning

**For Home:**
- A simple homework checklist Pat fills out before leaving class each day
- One designated homework folder (nothing else goes in it)
- Starting with just 15 minutes of focused work, then a break
- Celebrating small wins (completed one problem = success)

I'm also going to recommend a meeting with our school counselor, Ms. Williams, who specializes in executive functioning support for middle schoolers. She has great strategies for students like Pat.

Let's give these strategies 2-3 weeks and then check in. I really believe we can help Pat build confidence and skills.

Best,
Mr. Thompson

## Teacher Reflection (Private Note)

This parent communication confirms my classroom observations. Pat's executive functioning challenges are significant and longstanding. However, the parent's note about Pat's engagement with social justice issues is valuable information. This aligns with Montessori's Third Plane theory—middle schoolers have a sensitive period for morality and fairness. If I can connect assignments to real-world ethical problems, I might bypass some of Pat's initiation barriers.

Next week: Try framing a math word problem around resource distribution or environmental equity. See if Pat's natural curiosity can overcome the executive functioning hurdles.

**Skills Observed (from parent report):**
- Task Initiation: Emerging (significant difficulty starting work, requires extensive support)
- Organization: Emerging (struggles to manage materials and time)
- Self-Management: Emerging (shuts down when overwhelmed)
- Critical Thinking: Developing (makes sophisticated connections with engaging content)
- Global Awareness: Developing (naturally curious about social issues and inequality)
- Self-Awareness: Emerging (knows something is difficult but can't identify specific strategies)
