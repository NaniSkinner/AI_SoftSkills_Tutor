# Middle School Non-Academic Skills Rubric: Behavioral Indicators for LLM Context Engineering

This rubric provides defined behavioral indicators for the 17 core non-academic skills identified in the curriculum. It is designed to enable an LLM to recognize and categorize student proficiency levels based on transcripts, notes, and observational data.

**Proficiency Levels:**

- **Emerging (E):** Needs significant, consistent support; skill application is inconsistent or absent.
- **Developing (D):** Applies the skill with frequent prompting or scaffolding; inconsistent success.
- **Proficient (P):** Applies the skill independently and consistently in familiar contexts; generally successful.
- **Advanced (A):** Applies the skill flexibly and strategically in novel or challenging contexts; models the skill for others.
